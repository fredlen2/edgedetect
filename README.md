Edgedetect
==========

An audio content recognition system that also detect trigger words and perform certain actions.

Edgedetect can memorize audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input, Edgedetect attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the database, returning the ad/song being played. 

Note that for voice recognition, Edgedetect is not the right tool for now! Edgedetect excels at recognition of exact signals with reasonable amounts of noise.
