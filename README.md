Detectrig
==========

An audio content recognition system that also detect trigger words and perform certain actions.

Detectrig can memorize audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input, Detectrig attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the database, returning the song being played. 

Note that for voice recognition, Detectrig is not the right tool! Detectrig excels at recognition of exact signals with reasonable amounts of noise.
